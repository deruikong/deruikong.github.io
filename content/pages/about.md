Hi, I am Ray Kong!

Perhaps you may know me from one of my onlines handles: unoptimize or kdrkdr.

I am an incoming freshman studying Computer Science at University of Waterloo. Currently, I am a grade 12 student attending Appleby College.

I have spent a significant chunk of my high school years practicing competitive programming. You can find me on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/kdrkdr) and [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/kdrkdr). Outside of that, I enjoy playing guitar (mainly Jazz), cubing, and playing soccer / football. Oh yeah, I also play a *bit* of [Minecraft](https://plancke.io/hypixel/player/stats/unoptimize#BedWars).

You may be interested in checking out my [resume]() or [projects]({{< relref "projects">}}), or shoot me a message on Discord @ Ray#2029.
